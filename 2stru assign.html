        With the recent increase in the number of positive COVID-19 cases, the Ministry of Health in Lao People’s Democratic Republic is promoting home-based recovery for patients with mild or no symptoms. This is to ensure the country keeps the hospitals and isolation facilities available to those who need it most. 
        
        Dr Bounfeng Phoumalaysith, Minister of Health, ‘‘In light of the upcoming Pi Mai Lao, I would like to urge everyone to strictly follow all preventive measures, including wearing a well-fitted face mask, avoiding crowds, covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning hands frequently and maintaining physical distancing to protect yourself and your community. Please stay home if you feel unwell or develop COVID-19 related symptoms and follow the recommended steps in the home-based recovery guidelines. While we celebrate the Lao New Year, let's ensure that our loved ones stay protected from COVID-19, and please get vaccinated as soon as it is your turn..’’
        
        Dr Ying-Ru Jacqueline Lo, World Health Organization (WHO) Representative to Lao PDR. “Recovering safely at home is part of Lao's longer-term plan to manage COVID-19 while protecting health systems and reducing pressure on health care workers. People who are not in a high-risk category and without symptoms or with only mild symptoms can recover safely at home by following some sensible precautions and seeking help if their symptoms worsen.”
        
        "WHO will continue to work with the Ministry of Health to manage surges in cases and transition to sustainable management of COVID-19 by addressing areas such as making effective use of the health system by advising on care pathways (where patients are cared for), treatment, infection prevention and control, as well as providing credible, reliable information so people can continue to protect themselves, the vulnerable and their local health system," added Dr Lo.
        
        If you have tested positive for COVID-19, here are 9 steps you can follow to avoid spreading the infection, keep everyone safe and know what to do if your symptoms worsen. Many of these steps are also useful for people who have been asked to isolate after being exposed to someone with COVID-19.
